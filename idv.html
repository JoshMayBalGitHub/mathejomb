    <p style="color:#AD8B73; text-align:center;" > Good day! I am here to talk more in-depth about 
     <em>Independent and Dependent Variables,</em> as we have learned about Relation and Function and
     Domain and Range previously.</p>

     <h2 style="color:#AD8B73; text-align:center;">What are Independent and Dependent Variables?</h2>
     <p style="color:#AD8B73; text-align:center;">
        A <b>Variable</b> is simply a symbol that represents an
        unknown variable. It is usually represented by letters like x, y, and others.
        Meanwhile, an <b>Independent Variable </b>is a type of variable that can stand alone
        and is not dependent on any other variable. It is also referred to as the input
        of the function. Although, a <b>Dependent Variable </b>is a type of variable that
        depends on other variables / factors. In other words, it is affected by the changes
        on the <b>Independent Variable</b>. It is also referred to as the output of the function. </p>
    <p style="color:#AD8B73; text-align:center;">
        <em>Remember: </em>For example, the variable X is considered as the independent variable 
        because any value could be assigned to it. However, the variable Y is considered the
        dependent variable because it depends on X's value.

            3. Angel is considering the amount of words she can type on her computer
            due to her limited bond paper amount so she can print her essay.

            <br>

        </p>
        <div id="HiddenAnswer3" class="Hide" style="color:#CEAB93; text-align:center;">
            Independent Variable: Amount of water into the plant
            <br>
            Dependent Variable: Amount of growth of the plant

    <p style="color:#AD8B73; text-align:center;">
        <b><em>Remember:</em></b>
        <br>
        We use the example sentence "(Dependent Variable) depends on (Independent Variable)"
        to determine which of the words / phrases represent. For example: "The amount of 
        video games played depends on the amount of free time the person has".
        <br>
        Independent Variable: Amount of free time
        <br>
        Dependent Variable: Amount of video games played
